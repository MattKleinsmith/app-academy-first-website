      <h1>Goal</h1>
      <p>To create an educational video game.</p>
      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>To increase the <strong>meaning</strong> of video games.
      <h2>Backstory and details</h2>
      <p>Nowadays, I only play video games with friends. Without my friends being there to justify
        the time spent, it becomes salient to me that I've just honed a skill that is trapped inside a virtual world; I
        have
        just gained knowledge that is forever irrelevant from the world I live in.</p>
      <p>While outside the scope of an App Academy goal, I would like to one day create a game I can play with my
        friends,
        one that
        hones our relevant skills and gives us relevant knowledge.</p>
      <p>The scope of this planned game, however, will be small. It will target a specific, relevant skill.</p>
      <p>I do not yet know which skill the game will target, but I will use this project to explore this topic.</p>
